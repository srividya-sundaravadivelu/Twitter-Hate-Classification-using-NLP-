# Twitter-Hate-Classification-using-NLP-
DESCRIPTION  Using NLP and ML, make a model to identify hate speech (racist or sexist tweets) in Twitter.  Problem Statement:    Twitter is the biggest platform where anybody and everybody can have their views heard. Some of these voices spread hate and negativity. Twitter is wary of its platform being used as a medium  to spread hate.   You are a data scientist at Twitter, and you will help Twitter in identifying the tweets with hate speech and removing them from the platform. You will use NLP techniques, perform specific cleanup for tweets data, and make a robust model.  Domain: Social Media  Analysis to be done: Clean up tweets and build a classification model by using NLP techniques, cleanup specific for tweets data, regularization and hyperparameter tuning using stratified k-fold and cross validation to get the best model.  Content:   id: identifier number of the tweet  Label: 0 (non-hate) /1 (hate)  Tweet: the text in the tweet.
